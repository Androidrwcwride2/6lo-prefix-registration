              IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Prefix Registration
                draft-thubert-6lo-prefix-registration-00

Abstract

   This document updates RFC 8505 to enable a node that owns or is
   directly connected to a prefix to register that prefix to neighbor
   routers.  The registration indicates that the registered prefix can
   be reached via the advertising node without a loop.  The prefix
   registration also provides a protocol-independant interface for the
   node to request neighbor router(s) to redistribute the prefix to the
   larger routing domain using their specific routing protocols.  As an
   example, this document extends RFC 9010 to enable the 6LR to inject
   the registered prefix in RPL.

1.  Introduction

   The design of Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) is generally
   focused on saving energy, which is the most constrained resource of
   all.  Other design constraints, such as a limited memory capacity,
   duty cycling of the LLN devices and low-power lossy transmissions,
   derive from that primary concern.  The radio (both transmitting or
   simply listening) is a major energy drain and the LLN protocols must
   be adapted to allow the nodes to remain sleeping with the radio
   turned off at most times.

Internet-Draft             Prefix Registration              October 2022


   The "Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks" [RFC6550]
   (RPL) provides IPv6 [RFC8200] routing services within such
   constraints.  To save signaling and routing state in constrained
   networks, the RPL routing is only performed along a Destination-
   Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) that is optimized to reach a
   Root node, as opposed to along the shortest path between 2 peers,
   whatever that would mean in each LLN.

   This trades the quality of peer-to-peer (P2P) paths for a vastly
   reduced amount of control traffic and routing state that would be
   required to operate an any-to-any shortest path protocol.
   Additionally, broken routes may be fixed lazily and on-demand, based
   on dataplane inconsistency discovery, which avoids wasting energy in
   the proactive repair of unused paths.

   The classical "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND) Protocol" [RFC4861]
   [RFC4862] was defined for serial links and shared transit media such
   as Ethernet at a time when broadcast was cheap on those media while
   memory for neighbor cache was expensive.  It was thus designed as a
   reactive protocol that relies on caching and multicast operations for
   the Address Discovery (aka Lookup) and Duplicate Address Detection
   (DAD) of IPv6 unicast addresses.  Those multicast operations
   typically impact every node on-link when at most one is really
   targeted, which is a waste of energy, and imply that all nodes are
   awake to hear the request, which is inconsistent with power saving
   (sleeping) modes.

   The original 6LoWPAN ND, "Neighbor Discovery Optimizations for
   6LoWPAN networks" [RFC6775], was introduced to avoid the excessive
   use of multicast messages and enable IPv6 ND for operations over
   energy-constrained nodes.  [RFC6775] changes the classical IPv6 ND
   model to proactively establish the Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE)
   associated to the unicast address of a 6LoWPAN Node (6LN) in the a
   6LoWPAN Router(s) (6LR) that serves it.  To that effect, [RFC6775]
   defines a new Address Registration Option (ARO) that is placed in
   unicast Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement (NA)
   messages between the 6LN and the 6LR.

   "Registration Extensions for 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery" [RFC8505]
   updates [RFC6775] into a generic Address Registration mechanism that
   can be used to access services such as routing and ND proxy and
   introduces the Extended Address Registration Option (EARO) for that
   purpose.  This provides a routing-agnostic interface for a host to
   request that the router injects a unicast IPv6 address in the local
   routing protocol and provide return reachability for that address.

   "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Multicast Address Listener Subscription"
   [I-D.ietf-6lo-multicast-registration] updates [RFC8505] to enable a
   listener to subscribe an IPv6 anycast or multicast address; the draft
   also extends [RFC9010] to enable the 6LR to inject the anycast and
   multicast addresses in RPL.  Similarly, this specification extends
   [RFC8505] and [RFC9010] to add the capability for the 6LN to register
   prefixes as opposed to addresses, and to signal in a protocol-
   independant fashion to the 6LR that it is expected to redistribute
   the prefixes in their specific routing protocols.

2.4.  New terms

   This document introduces the following terms:

   Origin  The node that issued the prefix advertisement, either in the
          form of a NS(EARO) or as a DAO(TIO, RTO)
   Merge/merging  The action of receiving multiple anycast or multicast
          advertisements, either internally from self, in the form of a
          NS(EARO), or as a DAO(TIO, RTO), and generating a single
          DAO(TIO, RTO).  The 6RPL router maintains a state per origin
          for each advertised address, and merges the advertisements for
          all subsriptions for the same address in a single
          advertisement.  A RPL router that merges becomes the origin of
          the merged advertisement and uses its own values for the Path
          Sequence and ROVR fields.

3.  Overview

   This specification inherits from [RFC6550], [RFC8505], and [RFC9010]
   to register prefixes as opposed to addresses.  Unless specified
   otherwise therein, the behavior of the 6LBR that acts as RPL Root, of
   the intermediate routers down the RPL graph, of the 6LR that act as
   access routers and of the 6LNs that are the RPL-unaware destinations,
   is the same as for unicast addresses.  In particular, forwarding a
   packet happens as specified in section 11 of [RFC6550], including

   loop avoidance and detection, though in the case of multicast
   multiple copies might be generated.

   [RFC8505] is a pre-requisite to this specification.  A node that
   implements this MUST also implement [RFC8505].  This specification
   does not introduce a new option; it modifies existing options and
   updates the associated behaviors to enable the Registration for
   Multicast Addresses as an extension to [RFC8505].

   This specification also extends [RFC6550] and [RFC9010] in the case
   of a route-over multilink subnet based on the RPL routing protocol,
   to add multicast ingress replication in Non-Storing Mode and anycast
   support in both Storing and Non-Storing modes.  A 6LR that implements
   the RPL extensions specified therein MUST also implement [RFC9010].

   Figure 1 illustrates the classical situation of an LLN as a single
   IPv6 Subnet, with a 6LoWPAN Border Router (6LBR) that acts as Root
   for RPL operations and maintains a registry of the active
   registrations as an abstract data structure called an Address
   Registrar for 6LoWPAN ND.

   The LLN may be a hub-and-spoke access link such as (Low-Power) Wi-Fi
   [IEEE80211] and Bluetooth (Low Energy) [IEEE802151], or a Route-Over
   LLN such as the Wi-SUN and 6TiSCH meshes
   [I-D.heile-lpwan-wisun-overview] that leverages 6LoWPAN
   [RFC4919][RFC6282] and RPL [RFC6550] over [IEEE802154].

Internet-Draft             Prefix Registration              October 2022


   A leaf acting as a 6LN registers its unicast, multicast, and anycast
   addresses a RPL router acting as a 6LR, using a layer-2 unicast NS
   message with an EARO as specified in [RFC8505] and
   [I-D.ietf-6lo-multicast-registration].  The registration state is
   periodically renewed by the Registering Node, before the lifetime
   indicated in the EARO expires.  As for unicast IPv6 addresses, the
   6LR uses an EDAR/EDAC exchange with the 6LBR to notify the 6LBR of
   the presence of the listeners.

   This specification updates the EARO with one new flag, the P flag for
   Prefix, as detailed in Section 7.1.  The existing R flag that
   requests reachability for the registered address gets new behavior.
   With this extension the 6LNs can now attract the traffic for a full
   prefix, using the new P flag in the EARO to signal that the
   registration is for a prefix.  Multiple 6LN may register the same
   prefix to the same 6LR or to different 6LRs.

   If the R flag is set in the subscription of one or more 6LNs for the
   same address, the 6LR is requested to redistributes the prefix in
   other routing protocol (e.g., RPL), based on the longest subscription
   lifetime across the active subscriptions for the prefix.

   It is possible to leverage this specification between the 6LN and the
   6LR for the registration of prefixes in networks that are not
   necessarily LLNs, and/or where the routing protocol between the 6LR
   and above is not necessarily RPL.

4.  Updating RFC 4861

   [RFC4861] expects that the NS/NA exchange is for a unicast address,
   which is indicated in the Target Address field of the ND message.
   This specification Amends [RFC4861] by allowing to advertise a prefix
   in the Target Address field when the NS or NA message is used for a
   registration, per section 5.5 of [RFC8505]; in that case, the prefix
   length is indicated in the EARO of the NS message, overloading the
   field that is used in the NA response for the Status.

5.  Extending RFC 7400

   This specification Extends "6LoWPAN-GHC: Generic Header Compression
   for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs)"
   [RFC7400] by defining a new capability bit for use in the 6CIO.
   [RFC7400] was already extended by [RFC8505] for use in IPv6 ND
   messages.

   The new "Registration for prefixes Supported" (F) flag indicates to
   the 6LN that the 6LR accepts IPv6 prefix registrations as specified
   in this document and will ensure that packets for the addresses that

   match this prefix will be routed to the 6LNs that registered the
   prefix, and the route to the prefix will be redistributed if the R
   flag is set to 1.

   counting 0 to 15 in network order in the 16-bit array), to be

      Addresses Supported"

6.  Updating RFC 6550

   [RFC6550] uses the Path Sequence in the Transit Information Option
   (TIO) to retain only the freshest unicast route and remove stale
   ones, e.g., in the case of mobility.  [RFC9010] copies the TID from
   the EARO into the Path Sequence, and the ROVR field into the
   associated RPL Target Option (RTO).  This way, it is possible to
   identify both the registering node and the order of registration in
   RPL for each individual advertisement, so the most recent path and
   lifetime values are used.

   [I-D.ietf-6lo-multicast-registration] requires the use of the ROVR
   field as the indication of the origin of a Target advertisement in
   the RPL DAO messages, as specified in section 6.1 of [RFC9010].  For
   anycast and multicast advertisements (in NS or DAO messages),
   multiple origins may subscribe to the same address, in which case the
   multiple advertisements from the different or unknown origins are
   merged by the common parent; in that case, the common parent becomes
   the origin of the merged advertisements and uses its own ROVR value.
   On the other hand, a parent that propagates an advertisement from a
   single origin uses the original ROVR in the propagated RTO, as it
   does for unicast address advertisements, so the origin is recognised
   across multiple hops.

Internet-Draft             Prefix Registration              October 2022


   This specification Extends [RFC6550] to require that, for prefix
   routes, the Path Sequence is used between and only between
   advertisements for the same Target and from the same origin (i.e,
   with the same ROVR value); in that case, only the freshest
   advertisement is retained.  But the freshness comparison cannot apply
   if the origin is not determined (i.e., the origin did not support
   this specification).

   [RFC6550] uses the Path Lifetime in the TIO to indicate the remaining
   time for which the advertisement is valid for unicast route
   determination, and a Path Lifetime value of 0 invalidates that route.
   [RFC9010] maps the Address Registration lifetime in the EARO and the
   Path Lifetime in the TIO so they are comparable when both forms of
   advertisements are received.

   The RPL router that merges multiple advertisement for the same prefix
   must use and advertise the longest remaining lifetime across all the
   origins of the advertisements for that prefix.  When the lifetime
   expires, the router sends a no-path DAO (i.e. the lifetime is 0)
   using the same value for ROVR value as for the previous
   advertisements, that is either self or the single descendant that
   advertised the Target.

   Note that the Registration Lifetime, TID and ROVR fields are also
   placed in the EDAR message so the state created by EDAR is also
   comparable with that created upon an NS(EARO) or a DAO message.  For
   simplicity the text below mentions only NS(EARO) but applies also to
   EDAR.

7.  Updating RFC 8505

7.1.  New EARO flag

   Section 4.1 of [RFC8505] defines the EARO as an extension to the ARO
   option defined in [RFC6775].

   This specification adds a new P flag to the EARO flags field to
   signal that the Registered Address is a prefix.  The A (signaling an
   anycast address), M (signaling a multicast address), and P (signaling
   a prefix) flags are mutually exclusive.

   Figure 3 illustrates the P flags in its suggested positions (1
   counting 0 to 7 in network order in the 8-bit array), to be confirmed
   by IANA.

                        Figure 3: EARO Option Format

   New and updated Option Fields:

   plen/Status  8-bit field: This field contains a prefix Length if the
      P flag is set in and the EARO is placed in an NS message.  The
      field contains a Status if the EARO is placed in an NA message
      regardless of the setting of the P flag.

   V  1-bit field: reserved, MUST be set to 0 and ignored by the
      receiver

   P  1-bit flag: "Registration for an IPv6 Prefix".  When the P flag is
      set to 1, the registration is for the prefix indicated in the NS
      Target using the prefix length signaled in the plen/Status field.

7.2.  New EDAR Message Flag field

   Section 4 of [RFC6775] provides the same format for DAR and DAC
   messages but the status field is only used in DAC message and has to
   set to zero in DAC messages.  [RFC8505] extends the DAC message as an
   EDAC but does not change the status field in the EDAR.

   This specification repurposes the status field in the EDAR and a
   Flags field.  It adds a new P flag to signal that a "Registration for
   an IPv6 Prefix".  As for EARO, the A, M, and P flags are mutually
   exclusive.

   Figure 4 illustrates the A and M flags in their suggested positions
   (0 and 1, respectively, counting 0 to 7 in network order in the 8-bit
   array), to be confirmed by IANA.

7.3.  Registering Extensions

   With [RFC8505]:

   *  A router that expects to reboot may send a final RA message, upon
      which nodes should subscribe elsewhere or redo the subscription to
      the same router upon reboot.  In all other cases, a node reboot is
      silent.  When the node comes back to life, existing registration
      state might be lost if it was not persisted, e.g., in persistent
      memory.

   *  Only unicast addresses can be registered.

   *  The 6LN must register all its ULA and GUA with a NS(EARO).

Internet-Draft             Prefix Registration              October 2022


   *  The 6LN may set the R flag in the EARO to obtain return
      reachability services by the 6LR, e.g., through ND proxy
      operations, or by injecting the route in a route-over subnet.

   *  the 6LR maintains a registration state per Registered Address,
      including an NCE with the Link Layer Address (LLA) of the
      Registered Node (the 6LN here).

   This specification adds the following behavior, similar to that
   introduced by [I-D.ietf-6lo-multicast-registration] for multicast
   addresses:

   *  The operation for registering prefixes is similar as for addresses
      from the perspective of the 6LN, but show important differences on
      the router side, which maintains a separate state for each origin
      and merges them in its own advertisements.

   *  The ARO Status indicating a "Registration Refresh Request" applies
      to prefixes as well.

      This status is used in asynchronous NA(EARO) messages to indicate
      to peer 6LNs that they are requested to reregister all addresses
      and prefixes that were previously registered to the originating
      node.  The NA message may be sent to a unicast or a multicast
      link-scope address and should be contained within the L2 range
      where nodes may effectively have registered/subscribed to this
      router, e.g., a radio broadcast domain.

      A device that wishes to refresh its state, e.g., upon reboot if it
      may have lost some registration state, SHOULD send an asynchronous
      NA(EARO) with this new status value.  That asynchronous NA(ARO)
      SHOULD be sent to the all-nodes link scope multicast address
      (FF02::1) and Target MUST be set to the link local address that
      was exposed previously by this node to accept registrations, and
      the TID MUST be set to 0.

      In an unreliable environment, the multicast NA(EARO) message may
      be resent in a fast sequence, in which case the TID must be
      incremented each time.  A 6LN that has recently processed the
      NA(ARO) ignores the NA(EARO) with a newer TID received within the
      duration of the fast sequence.  That duration depends on the
      environent and has to be configured.  By default, it is of 10
      seconds.

   *  Registration for prefixes is now supported.  A new flag is added
      to the EARO to signal when the registration is for a prefix as
      opposed to an address.

Internet-Draft             Prefix Registration              October 2022


   *  The Status field in the EDAR message that was repurposed to
      transport the flags to signal multicast and anycast is extended to
      transport the prefix registration as well.  The checks at the 6LBR
      for Duplicate Address Detection now need to incorporate validation
      of the right to register, which might be allowed in a range and
      provided that the prefix does not overlap with another existing
      registration.

   *  If the 6LB acts as a router to prefixes or owns the prefixes
      entirely, it SHOULD register all those prefixes on all interface
      from which it might be needed to relay traffic to that prefix, and
      it MUST set the P flag in the EARO for those prefixes.

   *  The 6LN MAY set the R flag in the EARO to request the 6LR to
      redistribute the prefix on other links using a routing protocol.
      The 6LR MUST NOT reregister that prefix to yet another router as
      it may create a loop.

   *  The 6LR and the 6LBR are extended to accept more than one
      registration for the same prefix, since multiple 6LNs may register
      it.  The Registration Ownership Verifier (ROVR) in the EARO
      identifies uniquely a registration within the namespace of the
      Registered Prefix.

   *  The 6LR MUST maintain a registration state per tuple (IPv6 prefix,
      ROVR) for all registered prefix.  It SHOULD notify the 6LBR with
      an EDAR message, unless it determined that the 6LBR is legacy and
      does not support this specification.  In turn, the 6LBR MUST
      maintain a registration state per tuple (IPv6 prefix, ROVR) for
      all prefixes.

8.  Updating RFC 9010

   With [RFC9010]:

   *  The 6LR injects only unicast routes in RPL

   *  Upon a registration with the R flag set to 1 in the EARO, the 6LR
      injects the address in the RPL unicast support.

   *  Upon receiving a packet directed to a unicast address for which it
      has an active registration, the 6LR delivers the packet as a
      unicast layer-2 frame to the LLA the nodes that registered the
      unicast address.

   This specification adds the following behavior:

Internet-Draft             Prefix Registration              October 2022


   *  Upon a registration with the R and the P flags set to 1 in the
      EARO, then the 6LR injects the prefix in RPL multicast support
      using a prefix RTO.

   *  Upon receiving a packet directed to an address that derives from a
      prefix for which it has at least one registration, the 6LR
      delivers a copy of the packet as a unicastlayer-2 frame to the LLA
      of exactly one of the nodes that registered to that prefix, using
      the longest match derivation to find the best 6LN.

9.  Leveraging RFC 8928

   Address-Protected Neighbor Discovery for Low-Power and Lossy Networks
   [RFC8928] was defined to protect the ownership of unicast IPv6
   addresses that are registered with [RFC8505].

   With [RFC8928], it is possible for a node to autoconfigure a pair of
   public and private keys and use them to sign the registration of
   addresses that are either autoconfigured or obtained through other
   methods.

   The first hop router (the 6LR) may then validate a registration and
   perform source address validation on packets coming from the sender
   node (the 6LN).

   Prefixes are not always owned by one node.  Multiple nodes may
   register the same prefix.  In that context, the method specified in
   [RFC8928] cannot be used with autoconfigured keypairs to protect a
   single ownership.

   For a prefix, as for an anycast or a multicast address, it is still
   possible to leverage [RFC8928] to enforce the right to register.  If
   [RFC8928] is used, a keypair MUST be associated with the prefix
   before it is deployed, and a ROVR MUST be generated from that keypair
   as specified in [RFC8928].  The prefix and the ROVR MUST then be
   installed in the 6LBR so it can recognize the prefix and compare the
   ROVR on the first registration to validate the right to register.

   The keypair MUST then be provisioned in each node that needs to
   subscribe to the prefix or a prefix within, so the node can follow
   the steps in [RFC8928] to register the prefix.

10.  Security Considerations

   This specification extends [RFC8505], and the security section of
   that document also applies to this document.  In particular, the link
   layer SHOULD be sufficiently protected to prevent rogue access.

Internet-Draft             Prefix Registration              October 2022


   Section 9 leverages [RFC8928] to prevent an rogue node to register a
   unicast address that it does not own.  The mechanism could be
   extended to anycast and multicast addresses if the values of the ROVR
   they use is known in advance, but how this is done is not in scope
   for this specification.  One way would be to authorize in a advance
   the ROVR of the valid users.  A less preferred way could be to
   synchronize the ROVR and TID values across the valid subscribers as a
   preshared key material.

   In the latter case, it could be possible to update the keys
   associated to a prefix in all the 6LNs, but the flow is not clearly
   documented and may not complete in due time for all nodes in LLN use
   cases.  It may be simpler to install a all-new address with new keys
   over a period of time, and switch the traffic to that address when
   the migration is complete.

11.  Backward Compatibility

   A legacy 6LN will not register prefixess and the service will be the
   same when the network is upgraded.  A legacy 6LR will not set the F
   flag in the 6CIO and an upgraded 6LN will not subscribe multicast
   addresses.

   Upon an EDAR message, a legacy 6LBR may not realize that the address
   being registered is anycast or multicast, and return that it is
   duplicate in the EDAC status.  The 6LR MUST ignore a duplicate status
   in the EDAR for anycast and multicast addresses.

12.  IANA Considerations

   Note to RFC Editor, to be removed: please replace "This RFC"
   throughout this document by the RFC number for this specification
   once it is allocated.  Also, the I Field is defined in [RFC9010] but
   is missing from the registry, so the bit positions must be added for
   completeness.

   IANA is requested to make changes under the "Internet Control Message
   Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6) Parameters" [IANA.ICMP] and the "Routing
   Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL)" [IANA.RPL] registry
   groupings, as follows:

12.1.  New EDAR Message Flags Registry
